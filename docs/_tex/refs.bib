  abstract = {This paper aims at clarifying the questions regarding the effects of the scaling method on the discrepancy function of the metric measurement invariance model. We provide examples and a formal account showing that neither the choice of the scaling method in general nor the choice of a particular referent indicator affects the value of the discrepancy function. Thus, the test statistic is not affected by the scaling method, either. The results rely on an appropriate application of the scaling restrictions, which can be phrased as a simple rule: "Apply the scaling restriction in one group only!" We develop formulas to calculate the degrees of freedom of {$\chi^2$}-difference tests comparing metric models to the corresponding configural model. Our findings show that it is impossible to test the invariance of the estimated loading of exactly one indicator, because metric MI models aimed at doing so are actually equivalent to the configural model.},

In one school most of the parents were foreign born, in the other chiefly American born. Bi-factor analysis has been applied to the intercorrelations of test scores for each group separately. The loadings of one general and four group factors were determined for each school. Comparison of the results for the two groups indicates that, "generally speaking, the test material determines what factors may be measured by the tests and that the nature of the group tested determines, in large measure, the actual size of the factor weights."

  abstract = {"Structural Equations with Latent Variables" is a comprehensive treatment of the general structural equation system better known as the LISREL model. The book serves three purposes. First, it demonstrates the generality of this model. Rather than treating path analysis, recursive and nonrecursive models, classical econometrics, and confirmatory factor analysis as unique, they are treated as special cases of a common model. The second purpose is to emphasize the application of these techniques. Empirical examples appear throughout. Several chapters contain some of the LISREL or EQS programs the author used to obtain the results for the empirical examples. Finally, the book explores the crucial role played by substantive expertise in most stages of the modeling process.  "Structural Equations with Latent Variables" fills the gap existing in the treatment of this subject between introductory texts and specialized papers. It provides social scientists, market researchers, applied statisticians, other analysts, and graduate students with a thorough examination of LISREL/structural equation models. At the same time it presents new material on measurement reliability and validity, overall fit indices, model identification, and other topics.

  abstract = {Summary             Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  abstract = {Theory and methodology for exploratory factor analysis have been well developed for continuous variables. In practice, observed or measured variables are often ordinal. However, ordinality is most often ignored and numbers such as 1, 2, 3, 4, representing ordered categories, are treated as numbers having metric properties, a procedure which is incorrect in several ways. In this article we describe four approaches to factor analysis of ordinal variables which take proper account of ordinality and compare three of them with respect to parameter estimates and fit. The comparison is made both in terms of their relative methodological advantages and in terms of an empirical data example and two generated data examples. In particular, we discuss the issue of how to test the model and to measure model fit.},
